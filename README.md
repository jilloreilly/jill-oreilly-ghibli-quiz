# Studio Ghibli Quiz
Challenge 6 - A quiz created in JavaScript on the films from Studio Ghibli

## Description

This online quiz showcases the Javascript skills I have gained from Module 6 (Workig with Web APIs) of the Front-end Web Development Bootcamp. 

I have developed an online quiz about the films from the animation Studio Ghibli. The quiz runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code that I have written.

The application has been optimised for viewing across all devices. 

## Usage

1. The **Studio Ghibli** quiz can be accessed online on Github pages: [https://jilloreilly.github.io/jill-oreilly-ghibli-quiz/index.html](https://jilloreilly.github.io/jill-oreilly-ghibli-quiz/index.html)
2. Click on the "Start Quiz" button
